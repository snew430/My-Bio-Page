        <h3>North Carolina and Beyond...</h3>
        <p>To make a long and interesting story short, I found the love of my life, got married, and started traveling the world.  My personal goal was to see all 8 Wonders of the World (7 Modern and 1 Ancient) before we had kids.  So far we have seen five out of eight.  We have lived in North Carolina, Virginia, and currently Georgia since getting married and have not only learned alot from our travels, but also in our homes.</p>

        <h3>Atlanta, GA</h3>
        <p>What can I say about Atlanta?  I didn't know what to expect when I first came here.  It has got a little of everything.  You want a great Thai restaraunt? Check.  You want to go to a baseball game? Check.  You want to meet new people from every background imaginable and further develop your concept of how the world works? Check.  Then all of a sudden Covid happened.  I started taking my health more serious.  I began running a lot more than I used to and eventually took up martial arts.  I learned through my travels that you discover more about yourself when you get out of you comfort zone and immerse yourself into someone else's.</p>

        <h3>School</h3>
        <p>I love school and value education.  Through education, we can become better people and push the limits to what we know as a person, community, society, or even as an entire race for generations.  I decided that I wanted to enroll at Vanderbilt University's Coding bootcamp and continue to learn and get back to a world I was once familiar with.  Anything is possible as long as you work hard, stay grounded, and keep trust in the people you love...</p>
