        <h3>Where to start?</h3>
        <p>I grew up outside of Baltimore, Maryland and have been working my entire life.  When I was in High School, I became very interested in computers.  I taught myself how to build computers from scratch.  I had a summer job as a computer tech at our local community college.  I was even enrolled in AP Computer Science and learned things like C++ and JavaScript at a very young age.</p>

        <h3>Where I went from there...</h3>
        <p>I was a huge fan of sports at the time and decided to attend West Virginia University where I acheived my Bachelors Degree in Sport and Exercise Psychology.  After graduating, it was time to start a career.  I applied for a job in retail management.  Kept my head down, worked hard and never gave up.  My employer relocated me to North Carolina, and that is where my life took a serious change of direction...</p>
